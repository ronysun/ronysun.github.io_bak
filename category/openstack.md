Sample category page. You need to create a page for each category.
The category is inferred from the title of the page, but you can also
specify it with the `category` attribute in the front matter.

```md
---
layout: category
title: openstack 
---
```

Or ...

```md
---
layout: category
title: openstack
category: My Category
---
```
